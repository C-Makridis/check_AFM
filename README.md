# check AFM
Simple python script to check the validity of an AFM (Greek VAT Identification Number), based on its check digit.

Not very usefull, it is just my first attempt with Python, Tkinter and github.

It does work, but I do not think someome will find it useful. Maybe just the fuction checkAFM() so as not to re invent the wheel.
